# Manifest: php-agent-framework

## System
- Runtime: Bun 1.3.1, TypeScript, Manifest 0.1.x
- Generated: 2026-02-15

## Architecture
This is a Manifest application. All behavior lives in feature files.
- features/ - One file per application behavior (1 features)
- schemas/ - Drizzle ORM table definitions (0 schemas)
- services/ - Shared services (0 services)
- commands/ - CLI commands (0 commands)

## Conventions
- NEVER use decorator-based patterns. Features are defined with defineFeature().
- NEVER create event listeners or middleware. Side effects go in the feature's handle() function.
- NEVER scatter one behavior across multiple files. One feature = one file.
- Every input field MUST have a description.
- Features MUST declare all side effects in the feature definition.
- Schema fields MUST have JSDoc descriptions.
- All dependencies MUST be explicit imports. No global state, no service locators.
