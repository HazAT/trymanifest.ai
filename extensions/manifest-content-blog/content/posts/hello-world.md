Welcome to your new blog! This is a sample post showing the markdown features you can use.

## Headings

Use `##` through `####` for section headings. The post title comes from frontmatter, so start content at `##`.

## Text Formatting

You can write **bold**, *italic*, and `inline code`. Links look like [this](https://example.com).

## Code Blocks

```typescript
const greeting = "Hello from Manifest!";
console.log(greeting);
```

## Lists

- First item
- Second item
- Third item with **bold** text

1. Ordered first
2. Ordered second
3. Ordered third

## Blockquotes

## Images

![Alt text for your image](/images/example.png)

Put images in `frontend/public/images/` and reference them with absolute paths.

---

That's it! Create new posts by adding `.md` files to `content/posts/` with the same frontmatter format.
