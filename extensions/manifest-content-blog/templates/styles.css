 * Typography plugin styles are applied by Tailwind CLI, not Bun's bundler.
 * Run: bunx @tailwindcss/cli -i frontend/styles.css -o dist/index.css

 * The `prose` class from @tailwindcss/typography handles all article formatting:
 * headings, paragraphs, lists, code blocks, blockquotes, links, etc.
