# Vision

trymanifest.ai is the landing page for Manifest — the framework for building
AI-native applications. It's built with Manifest itself, dogfooding the
framework to showcase what it can do.

The goal is the best possible landing page: clear, compelling, and instantly
communicative about what Manifest is, why it exists, and how to get started.
It should make developers want to try Manifest within 30 seconds of landing.
