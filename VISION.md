# Vision

trymanifest.ai is the public website for Manifest — the framework where every line of code exists to be read, not just run.

It serves developers who are tired of magic, hidden behavior, and framework lock-in. The site explains what Manifest is, how it works, and why it exists — with the same clarity and intentionality that the framework demands of its own code.

Success looks like a developer landing on the site, understanding Manifest's philosophy in under a minute, and cloning the repo to start building.
