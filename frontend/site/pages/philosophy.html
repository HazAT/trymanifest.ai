        <p>
          For decades we organized ourselves by layer. Front-end engineers. Back-end engineers. Infrastructure engineers. Data engineers. Each with their own languages, tools, communities, and mental models.
        </p>

        <p>
          That specialization made sense. Building a responsive UI and tuning a database query are genuinely different skills. They still are. <span class="text-white">Specialization will always exist</span> — someone will always care more about pixel-perfect layouts, and someone else about query plans.
        </p>

        <p>
          But the lines are blurring. Agents don't see layers the same way humans do. An agent reading your codebase doesn't think "I'm a front-end engineer" — it reads the feature file, understands the API, writes the component, sets up the database table, and moves on. The full stack isn't a career path. It's a single context window.
        </p>

        <p class="text-white">
          In the end, we're all just engineers building applications.
        </p>

        <p>
          The tools need to catch up to that reality.

        The problem with <span class="text-amber glow-amber">current frameworks</span>

      <div class="space-y-6 text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Every framework you've used was designed by humans for humans. That's not a criticism — it was the right choice when humans were the ones writing code. But it produced a particular kind of complexity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Middleware chains. Decorator-based dependency injection. File-system routing conventions. Auto-discovery. Lifecycle hooks. Magic methods. Convention over configuration taken so far that understanding a single request requires knowing the framework by heart.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're an expert in Next.js or NestJS or Rails, you navigate this fluently. You've built the mental model. You know where things happen even when the code doesn't say so.
        </p>

        <p>
          Agents don't have that luxury. They don't have years of framework-specific intuition. And more importantly — <span class="text-white">all the code agents write needs to be explicit.</span> An agent can't rely on "well, the framework does this behind the scenes." It reads code. If the code doesn't say it, the agent doesn't know it.

  <!-- ════════════════ THE APPROACH ════════════════ -->

        What Manifest <span class="text-terminal glow">does differently</span>
      </h2>

      <div class="space-y-6 text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Manifest is a TypeScript framework that runs on Bun. That part is normal. What's different is the design constraint: <span class="text-white">every line of code must be readable by an agent that has zero framework-specific knowledge.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          One feature, one file. A feature declares its route, inputs, authentication, side effects, error cases, and business logic in a single <code class="text-terminal text-xs">defineFeature()</code> call. An agent reads one file and understands one complete behavior. No hunting across directories.
        </p>

        <p>
          The entire framework is ~3,100 lines of TypeScript source code that ships inside your project — not as an npm package. That's small enough to fit in a single context window. <span class="text-white">Your agent doesn't burn tokens guessing what the framework does — it reads it.</span> Router, validator, server, scanner, testing, CLI — all right there. When something breaks, the agent opens the file and fixes it. No Stack Overflow. No docs site. Just source code.
        </p>

        <p>
          No hidden functionality. No middleware. No decorators. No dependency injection. No file-system routing. No convention-based auto-discovery. If something happens, it's because the code says so.
        </p>

        <p class="text-neutral-500 text-sm">
          Token-efficient by design. The agent reads the framework once, understands it completely, and never wastes context on abstractions it can't see.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          But let's be clear: <span class="text-white">none of this is a guarantee your project won't become a mess.</span> Manifest can't do magic — in fact, it tries to do as little magic as possible. It gives you a clean foundation and gets out of the way. What you build on top of it is entirely up to you.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can make it as complex as you want. You can scatter logic across files, bury intent behind abstractions, build the same tangled architecture you're used to. Manifest won't stop you. It's a foundation, not a guardrail.
        </p>

        <p>
          What it does ask is that you <span class="text-white">change how you think about writing software.</span> Not "learn a new framework" — the framework is ~3,100 lines, your agent reads it in seconds. The shift is in how you approach the work: writing code that's meant to be read by something other than you, declaring intent explicitly, keeping behavior visible. That's a mindset change, not a tooling change.

        Agents at <span class="text-amber glow-amber">every step</span>
      </h2>

      <div class="space-y-6 text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Most tools treat agents as a development aid — a smarter autocomplete, a code reviewer, a pair programmer. Manifest goes further. Agents aren't just part of the writing process. They're part of the entire lifecycle.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-neutral-950 border border-neutral-800 rounded p-4 sm:p-6 my-8 space-y-3 text-sm">
          <div class="code-line pl-4 py-1"><span class="text-terminal">Development.</span> <span class="text-neutral-500">Agents read your codebase and build features on top of it.</span></div>
          <div class="code-line pl-4 py-1"><span class="text-terminal">Onboarding.</span> <span class="text-neutral-500">Spark walks you through setup — an agent bootstrapping your project.</span></div>
          <div class="code-line pl-4 py-1"><span class="text-terminal">Refactoring.</span> <span class="text-neutral-500">The framework is source code. Agents evolve it alongside your app.</span></div>
          <div class="code-line pl-4 py-1"><span class="text-terminal">Monitoring.</span> <span class="text-neutral-500">Spark watches your running application, catches errors, acts on your behalf.</span></div>
          <div class="code-line pl-4 py-1"><span class="text-terminal">Self-healing.</span> <span class="text-neutral-500">Error fires → agent reads the feature → fixes it → Bun hot-reloads → next request works.</span></div>
        </div>

        <p>
          The self-healing loop is the most ambitious part. An error occurs. The agent reads <code class="text-terminal text-xs">MANIFEST.md</code> to orient itself. It reads the feature file — one file, complete behavior. It diagnoses the issue, edits the code, and Bun hot-reloads the module. No deploy. No restart. The next request runs the new code.
        </p>

        <p>
          This only works because every design decision in Manifest was made to support it. One file per feature so the agent edits one file. Declared side effects so the agent knows the blast radius. Source-code framework so the agent can fix anything. No hidden behavior so the agent's model matches reality.

        It's <span class="text-terminal glow">early</span>
      </h2>

      <div class="space-y-6 text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Manifest is young. The core framework works — features, validation, routing, testing, CLI, frontend support, streaming, rate limiting, event-triggered features, database integration, Docker deployment. Spark — the agent sidecar — watches your app in development and production. You can build real things with it today.
        </p>

        <p>
          We're not hiding what's still ahead. The roadmap is public. The framework is ~3,100 lines you can read in minutes. There are no announcements about announcements.
        </p>

        <p>
          What exists is solid. What's coming is ambitious. The gap between the two is where the experiment lives.
        </p>

        <p class="text-white">
          This is for people who want to try a different way of working with agents.
        </p>

        <p>
          Not everyone will want this. If your team has deep Rails expertise and it serves you well, keep using Rails. If Next.js gives you what you need and you understand the trade-offs, use Next.js. We're not here to tell you your tools are wrong.
        </p>

        <p>
          But if you've felt the friction — agents struggling with framework conventions they can't see, code scattered across files for organizational reasons that don't help the reader, abstractions that hide more than they reveal — then Manifest might be worth an afternoon.
